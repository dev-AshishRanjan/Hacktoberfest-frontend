# First ever Hackathon
<p align='justify'>
This was the first ever Hackathon which I participated in my First Semester in College! It was a Web-dev Inter-clg Hackathon and I was the only first yr student who participated! <br>
I was the <b> <i> only first year </i> </b> student who had known a-bit about hackathons and had made a front-end website, okay frankly only html and css part of it, the page wasn't responsive as well, 
  though I had tried a lot to make it! Back then I never knew what GitHub was! On one side I was pushing myself to make the website responsive, and on the other I struggled a lot for even understanding Repositories 
  and <b> <i> Open-source Contributions </i> </b> , 
  but hurrayyyyy!!! at the neck of the moment I could submit whatever I had done! This repo is exactly the same and untouched, coz I want to save this as a memory ( First block of codes that
  I had written in 3-4 hours time constraint) </p>
